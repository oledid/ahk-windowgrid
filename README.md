# ahk-windowgrid
Extend the default keyboard shortcuts for moving windows, increasing the number of screen columns.

Uses [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and is used by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>Arrows</kbd>.

### Known issues

1. Only works on the primary monitor. I might not ever fix this, because when I have multiple monitors, I will probably just use the default windows shortkeys (<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>Arrows</kbd> and <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>Arrows</kbd>)
